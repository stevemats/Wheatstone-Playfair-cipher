## C code to encrypt a string using the Playfair cipher(This cipher was invented by Charles Wheatstone at around 1854)

- There are two main types of cryptography in use:
1. *Symmetric key cryptography* - When the same key is used for both encryption and decryption
2. _Asymmetric key cryptography_ - When one key is used for encryption and another for decryption

- The Playfair cipher  or Playfair square or Wheatstoneâ€“Playfair cipher, is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, meaning that one letter can be denoted by different letters in its encryption, depending on the keyword used, which is given to both parties.
